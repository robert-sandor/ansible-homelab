# Mounts
#
# system_group_mounts and system_host_mounts allow you to setup mounts for a group of nodes, separately from mounts that only go on one server
# these will be combined on a per-host basis - NOTE: deduplication is done on the key basis, so avoid mounting the same path in both places
#
# See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/posix/mount_module.html# for full reference
# All mounts in this list are set with state=mounted and boot=true (mounts the filesystem, and auto-mounts on boot)
# Examples:
#
# NFS:
#
#   nfsshare:
#     src: 192.168.1.5:/nfs/remote/path
#     path: /mnt/nfsshare
#     opts: rw,sync,hard
#     fstype: nfs
#
# SMB/CIFS:
#
#   smbshare:
#     src: //192.168.1.5/smbshare
#     path: /mnt/smbshare
#     opts: "rw,vers=3,file_mode=0600,dir_mode=0700,username=smbuser,password=verysecurepassword"
